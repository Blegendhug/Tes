  <h1>Real Facts</h1>
  <h2>Tiger</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The tiger, one of the most powerful predators in the world, commands respect with its sheer size and strength. Known for their remarkable speed and ability to hunt prey far larger than themselves, tigers are both feared and admired in the wild.</p>
    <p>In the wild, tigers symbolize raw power and courage. They thrive in diverse habitats, from tropical forests to open grasslands. While their numbers continue to dwindle, tigers remain a beloved icon across the globe.</p>
    <p>One of the most fascinating facts about tigers is that they are the only big cat species that lives a solitary life. Unlike lions, which form prides, tigers prefer to hunt and live alone, showcasing their independence.</p>
    <p>Each tiger’s fur pattern is unique, like a fingerprint. These striking stripes not only add to their beauty but also provide excellent camouflage in their natural habitat, helping them remain hidden from potential threats and prey.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, tigers are incredibly territorial. They command vast areas of land and fiercely protect their domains from other tigers. These territories can span many kilometers, depending on the availability of prey.</p>
    <p>As skilled hunters, tigers prefer to stalk their prey silently during the night. With excellent hearing and night vision, they approach their quarry without detection, making them formidable and stealthy hunters.</p>
    <p>Despite their fearsome reputation, tigers do occasionally become prey themselves to larger animals like bears or humans. However, attacks on humans are rare and usually occur due to hunger or a sense of threat.</p>
    <p>With sharp claws and massive canine teeth, tigers are perfectly designed for a life of hunting. Their claws are razor-sharp, and their teeth can grow up to 10 centimeters in length, allowing them to kill their prey swiftly and efficiently.</p>
    <p>Tigers also have a distinct, powerful roar that can be heard over long distances. This roar serves to mark their territory and ward off other tigers that might encroach on their domain.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, tigers are currently endangered due to habitat loss, illegal poaching, and the black market trade of tiger parts. Conservation efforts are underway to save these magnificent creatures, including reforestation projects and stricter anti-poaching laws.</p>
    <p>As of the latest estimates, there are only around 3,900 tigers left in the wild—a dramatic decline compared to their numbers in the past.</p>
    <p>In 2010, world leaders gathered in St. Petersburg, Russia, to sign the "Tiger Declaration," aiming to double the tiger population in the wild by 2022. However, significant challenges remain in this ambitious conservation effort.</p>
    <p>On a brighter note, countries like India and Russia have successfully increased their tiger populations through effective conservation programs, setting a positive example for global tiger preservation efforts.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, tigers hold cultural significance in many countries. In China, the tiger is a symbol of strength and bravery, while in India, it is considered a symbol of luck and protection.</p>
    <p>Tigers also have many different names in various languages. In India, they are called "Sher," in Japan they are referred to as "Tora," and in English, they are simply known as "Tiger."</p>
    <p>Moreover, tigers play a crucial role in their ecosystem. As apex predators, they help maintain a balance in herbivore populations, preventing overgrazing and ensuring the health of their environment.</p>
    <p>Overall, tigers are truly remarkable creatures. From their physical prowess to their essential role in the wild, they continue to inspire awe and admiration, while also being a focus of important conservation efforts worldwide.</p>
