  <h1>Real Facts</h1>
  <h2>Mouse</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The mouse, a small but highly adaptable mammal, is one of the most common animals found in households around the world. Known for their small size and quick movements, mice are often seen as pests but also play crucial roles in various ecosystems.</p>
    <p>There are over 30 species of mice, but the most commonly encountered species is the house mouse. These rodents have evolved to live in close proximity to humans, scavenging for food and nesting in homes, barns, and warehouses.</p>
    <p>Mice are known for their excellent sense of smell and hearing. They use these senses to detect food, navigate their environment, and avoid predators. Their ability to fit through tiny gaps and their speed make them particularly difficult to catch or contain.</p>
    <p>Despite their small size, mice are highly intelligent animals. They are capable of learning complex tasks, recognizing objects, and even using tools in some cases. Their brains are also remarkably similar to human brains, making them popular subjects for scientific research.</p>
    <p>One interesting fact about mice is their reproductive capabilities. Mice can reproduce at an astonishing rate, with a single pair of mice potentially producing hundreds of offspring in just one year. This rapid breeding rate contributes to their large populations in the wild.</p>
    <p>Mice are omnivores and will eat a wide range of foods. They are known to enjoy grains, seeds, fruits, and even small insects. Their sharp teeth allow them to gnaw on a variety of materials, including wood, plastic, and even electrical wires, which can sometimes cause damage in homes.</p>
    <p>Although mice are often viewed as pests, they also have important ecological roles. In the wild, they serve as a primary food source for many predators, including owls, hawks, snakes, and other carnivores. Their presence helps maintain the balance of these ecosystems.</p>
    <p>In addition, mice have been vital in scientific research. Due to their genetic similarities to humans, mice are used in medical experiments, helping scientists understand human biology, diseases, and potential treatments. Many groundbreaking medical discoveries have been made using mice as test subjects.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, mice are also known for their social behavior. They live in groups, communicate with each other through squeaks and high-pitched sounds, and often groom one another to maintain social bonds.</p>
    <p>Despite their reputation for being pests, many people find mice fascinating due to their agility, intelligence, and adaptability. They have even become popular characters in cartoons and movies, such as the beloved Mickey Mouse.</p>
    <p>However, mice can be carriers of diseases, such as salmonella and hantavirus, which can spread to humans. This is one of the main reasons why mice are often considered pests when they invade homes and businesses.</p>
    <p>Overall, while mice may be small and often misunderstood, they are incredibly resourceful animals with significant ecological and scientific value. Their adaptability ensures that they will continue to thrive in diverse environments around the world.</p>
